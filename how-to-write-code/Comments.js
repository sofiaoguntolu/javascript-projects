   // This demo shows off comments!

   // console.log("This does not print.");

   console.log("Hello, World!"); // Comments do not have to start at the beginning of a line.

 /* I'm writing
 my own
 multi

   console.log("Comments make your code more readable by others.");

// now i know how this works!
